	Class: A class is a blueprint of an object to be created.
	Object: Instance of class containing both data and methods.
	Encapsulation: Limiting access to properties, methods or variables in a class for code external to that class.
	Inheritance: It allows a class (commonly referred to as subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (commonly referred to as parent class).
	Polymorphism: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
	Abstraction: Abstracting a basic concept of multiple classes in a single abstract class. This simplifies logic and makes code more readable.

	Struct - contains methods and proterties

	type CompanyEntity struct {

	Go Modules- packages to export and unexport identifiers 
		- i.e, modify struct data
		- set private for module access only
	Inheritance
		- imbed structs in child struct
		- access embedded functions 
		- create new struct functions for embedded struct
		- In the following case where Employee embeds Company, the Employee struct can access (assume not private) Company struct data and method, but the methods are applied to 
			Company data only, not on   Salary int; for example:
			type Employee struct{
				Company;
				Salary int;
				}
		

	Polymorphism (allowing different objects to be treated as the same parent classs)
		- 1. test Interface with struct in test_service.go
			var _ CompanyInterface = &e 
		- 2. calling the function, pkg main: 
			e := Employee{
				CompanyEntity: CompanyEntity{Name: "OpenAI"},
				Salary:        100000,
			}
 		getCompanyNameInLowerCase(&e)

// Conccurrency and Parallel programming 

/*
Idea from textbook - 
CPU cores - one core one task at a time
Concurrent- concurrent means the core and swtich from doing task x then y then x.
Parallel - Thus, if multi-core, tasks can be assign and performed at the same time; assume no conflicts or race or other concurrency issues.


In the contecxt of Golang; Ref: https://medium.com/@ksandeeptech07/understanding-concurrency-and-parallelism-in-go-golang-f53afaf0387b 

Multi-core+ Parallel in Golang
		- Goruntime with go scheduler to distribute tasks in multi-core processing 
		- 
	Channel - Coordinatitions between tasks 
	(I'm writing from a perspective of C/C++ and Java since this is where I come from, where threads, thread pools, worker nodes are controlled manually). 
	Goroutines 
		- Remove this need for thread pool management mannually
		- concurrent threads, managed and scheduled by Go runtime by M:N scheduling 
		- go doWork(id, task)
	channels - Shared data and inner thread pool comminication
		-
